Constructors in Typescript

- constructor is a reserved keyword in Typescript
- a method which is called when we create the object/instance of a class
- in Typescript we can create only one constructor, multiple constructors are not allowed
- this keyword refers to current instance of the class
- parameters can be optional
- optional parameters are written in the last

constructor(<parameters>){
    <body>
}

class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
 
  // Normal signature with defaults
  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}

- constructor can be overloaded...
